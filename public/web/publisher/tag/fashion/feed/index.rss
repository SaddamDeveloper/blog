<p>If you read an article about how to live without an income every day for the rest of your life, you might be thinking, “Well … that isn’t going to happen.” But you’re wrong, because there is the possibility that we can achieve that on a daily basis.</p>



<p>It’s not easy, but there are some things that should be a minimum amount of work. At that, we can get away with not having to think about what to buy or what to take for granted. So we will focus solely on what we must do everyday to be a successful person.</p>



<p>I’ll be writing each of these articles on a different aspect of being a minimalist.</p>



<p>This article was originally published at BoredPanda and has since been republished here with permission.</p>



<p>Let’s start by saying this: You are not going to live your life like a caveman: You would want to starve out the hunger in your body to avoid wasting too much calories.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-floated"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://typer.seventhqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4307.min_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-579"/><figcaption>The ideal amount of clothing, makeup, and hairstyle — it all matters to me.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The problem is we have to work for the very basics of living a life of minimalism in order to be able to achieve this lifestyle. While we can have food, exercise, and time for fun.</p>



<p>The ideal amount of clothing, makeup, and hairstyle — it all matters to me. However, I also like to find a balance of items that are easy to find, easy to maintain, and can be reused time and again. I have a handful of personal products that I keep in my stash; if I really need to use an item more than once, I stick to it. If I’m trying to wear another item only once, I keep my eye out for products that allow my eye for a few minutes before I bring my eye mask and makeup down.</p>



<p>When it comes to clothes, I’m willing to experiment by shopping a “somewhat” basic mix of clothes that complement my lifestyle. While I don’t have the need to carry an entire wardrobe full of clothes that have an image of minimalism, I am flexible enough to make a decision to try it one day.</p>

<p>For example, in the past, when I’d be really desperate to find a good balance between light and bulky clothing</p>



<p><strong>How to Be a Fashion</strong>&nbsp;Show King&#8221; was an official guide and fashion book from the Royal Enfield Factory. It was illustrated with detailed illustrations of the main events.</p>



<p>The books sold like hot cakes before they were taken over by the National Museum in 2005 and, despite being a major influence on the world of fashion, they&#8217;re no longer in circulation. But there are a few collector&#8217;s items that remain that may still be worth a visit. Here they are!</p>



<p>The first was a large-scale replica of the original royal army uniform, which has still never been restored.</p>



<p>The second was an actual pair of pants that might be worth a lot more than they currently are.</p>
