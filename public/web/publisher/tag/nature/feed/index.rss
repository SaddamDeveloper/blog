<p class="has-drop-cap">There exist many similar, albeit lesser known, forms of art. The artwork used in The Black Forest is a prime example. The black forest consists of a large number of mountains, fields, lakes, and waterfalls. In the center of each of the mountains is a stone, where a stone cut of ice is in place. The waterfalls are in the form of streams made of water in a frozen state.</p>



<p>These waterfalls are linked by one connecting waterfall, which is the source of the ice that forms a conduit to the other two. This stone was carved by the Elves of the White Forest, and carved by the Elves of Gondor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-floated"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1793" srcset="https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_-300x225.jpg 300w, https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_-768x576.jpg 768w, https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_-45x34.jpg 45w, https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/illustration_hills_01.min_.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 75vw, 100vw" /></figure></div>



<p>This stone was used for the &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221; and &#8220;Tree of Memory.&#8221; There are also similar works of art found that have a more earthly appearance, although that is not to say they were never of an architectural or artistic nature.</p>



<p>These works of art may have been created by the Elves of Elvish descent.</p>



<p>To bring some of your new insights into light, we&#8217;ve teamed up with illustrator Kevin Murphy to present these fascinating new illustrations that illuminate a much more important aspect of the life of the Ancient Greeks.</p>
