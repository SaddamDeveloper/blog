<p>So what exactly was so hard about &#8220;Not Your Business&#8221;? The bottom line: If you&#8217;re a small business looking to grow online, it&#8217;s tough. It takes a lot of resources, effort and money. In fact, your success will be measured by whether you can get your content delivered on time — as opposed to just getting it through your &#8220;recreational&#8221; business — even once you&#8217;ve created your business (remember all the times you say you don&#8217;t want to make money?).</p>



<p>You may be thinking that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not making money, so the idea is ridiculous. That said, one thing that never changes is that it&#8217;s hard to stay out of your own little bubble.</p>



<p>At one point a friend of mine who was a graphic designer just started a blog named &#8220;How To Make A Living Online.&#8221; He was a big time content creator, but his content took him all over Europe and the USA and it was completely non-existent in the UK. We&#8217;d meet up and I&#8217;d talk to him or her all over again in his or her native language.</p>
