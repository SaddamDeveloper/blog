<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.</p><cite><strong>Helen Keller</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Explain what is quotes</strong>? This is a great opportunity to have an actual conversation about this.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say you can think of the above quote and you can also think of any other questions you have which could make the quote more interesting and relevant in terms of what we learned. You could start a conversation with your teacher then write what you are curious about down on paper to read the quote. It is important to use your teacher&#8217;s knowledge of the subject matter to help you think up your own question or thought.</p>
